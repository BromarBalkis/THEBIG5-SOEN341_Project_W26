Sprint 1 – MealMajor (SOEN 341 Winter 2026)

**Kareem Dadouche – Contribution Log**

Role: Front-End Developer & GitHub Setup

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily in two key areas: GitHub project setup and Front-End development. I was responsible for structuring the repository according to the project requirements and ensuring that all Sprint 1 deliverables were organized clearly within the designated folder hierarchy. 
I created and configured the Sprint1 directory structure, including folders for Demo Code, Sprint Plan, Minutes, and Logs. I also implemented the branch-based Git workflow by creating and working on the kareem-sprint1 branch, ensuring that all changes were properly committed, pushed, and merged via Pull Request 
into the main branch.

In addition to repository management, I structured and formatted GitHub Issues according to the required Scrum format using US.## for user stories and Task.## for implementation tasks. I ensured traceability between issues and the Sprint Plan table (Appendix A format) by aligning issue numbers, story points, risk levels, and assigned responsibilities. 
I created and finalized the Sprint Plan documentation and ensured it complied with the rubric requirements.
On the front-end side, I began the implementation of user interface components for Sprint 1 features, including the structure for registration, login, and profile management pages. I prepared the base layout and coordinated with the backend team to ensure alignment between UI forms and authentication logic. My work focused on ensuring that at least one
User Account Management feature could be successfully demonstrated as required for the sprint deliverable.

Overall, my contributions ensured that the team had a properly structured GitHub workflow, organized documentation, traceable issue tracking, and a functional starting point for the front-end implementation of the authentication system.

Role: fronten & Backend Coordinator

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily in the areas of team coordination, GitHub repository setup, backend preparation, and project documentation. I was responsible for coordinating and facilitating all team meetings, ensuring that discussions remained focused on sprint objectives, deliverables, and deadlines. I also coordinated team-wide decisions regarding the selection of development tools and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), ensuring consistency across all team members and alignment with project requirements.
I set up and structured the GitHub repository according to the project requirements and ensured that all Sprint 1 deliverables were clearly organized within the designated folder hierarchy. I created and configured the Sprint 1 directory structure, including folders for demo code, sprint planning documents, meeting minutes, and contribution logs. I also implemented and maintained the overall GitHub structure to support sprint-based development while preserving the integrity of each team member’s work throughout the sprint.
In addition to repository management, I coordinated the organization and maintenance of Sprint 1 documentation to ensure compliance with the course rubric. This included organizing sprint planning documents, meeting minutes, and logs in a clear and traceable manner. I ensured that all documentation was properly formatted and stored in the appropriate locations to support transparency and accountability across the team.
On the backend side, I set up and prepared the initial backend demo code required for the Sprint 1 deliverable. I organized the backend structure and ensured that a functional starting point was available to support user account management features, including registration and login. I coordinated with other team members to ensure alignment between backend functionality and overall project goals, while also completing my assigned sprint tasks as planned.
my contributions overall ensured that the team had a well-structured GitHub repository, coordinated and productive meetings, organized and compliant documentation, and a functional backend foundation to support the Sprint 1 demonstration and future development.



**Mcwill Buikpor – Contribution Log**

Role: Front-End Developer

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily to the front-end development of the MealMajor application. My focus was on building the initial user interface layout and supporting the creation of basic front-end pages required for the project’s early functionality. I worked on structuring the visual layout of the application to ensure consistency, usability, and alignment with the sprint objectives.

I assisted in developing the foundational front-end components, including setting up the initial page structure and applying basic styling to support a clean and user-friendly interface. This involved organizing UI elements in a logical manner and ensuring that the pages could later be easily connected to backend functionality. I collaborated closely with the other front-end team member to maintain consistency across pages and to align design decisions with the overall project vision.

In addition, I supported the styling process by applying CSS and layout adjustments to improve readability and visual flow. My contributions helped establish a solid front-end foundation that can be expanded upon in future sprints as additional features and interactivity are introduced.



**Omar Balkis – Contribution Log**

Role: Front-End Developer & Sprint Documentation Support

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily to the front-end development of the MealMajor application and supported the team in preparing Sprint 1 documentation. My work focused on implementing user interface components required for the sprint deliverable and ensuring that the front-end aligned with the project’s functional requirements.

On the front-end side, I worked on developing the structure and layout of user-facing pages, including the login, registration, and profile management interfaces. I focused on translating the user stories into functional UI components and ensured that the forms and page flows were consistent with the intended user experience. I collaborated with other team members to ensure that the front-end design aligned with the planned authentication and user account management features.

In addition to front-end development, I contributed to Sprint 1 documentation by assisting in the organization and review of sprint-related artifacts. I supported the preparation of documentation such as sprint plans and meeting notes, ensuring that they were clearly written and properly formatted according to the course guidelines. My involvement helped maintain clarity and consistency across the project’s documentation.



**Saib Merabet – Contribution Log**

Role: Backend Developer & Repository Implementation

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily to the backend development and implementation of the MealMajor application. My main responsibility was setting up and coding the core backend functionality required for the sprint deliverable, ensuring that the system could support user account management features in a functional and demonstrable manner.

I designed and implemented the backend logic for user authentication and account-related operations. This included setting up the backend subfolder within the GitHub repository, organizing the server-side code structure, and implementing the necessary endpoints to support registration and login functionality. I ensured that the backend code was functional, well-organized, and aligned with the project’s technical requirements for Sprint 1.

In addition to backend development, I was responsible for pushing backend code to the GitHub repository and maintaining version control best practices. I committed and pushed my changes consistently, ensuring that the backend implementation was properly tracked and accessible to the rest of the team. My work enabled smooth integration with other components of the project and supported collaborative development.
