## Project Overview
MealMajor is a student-focused web application that helps users plan weekly meals, manage groceries, and discover or create simple recipes. The application is designed to promote organized meal planning and healthier eating habits.

This project is developed as part of **SOEN 341 – Software Process (Winter 2026)** and follows an **Agile development approach** based on the **Scrum framework**, with the project delivered incrementally across multiple sprints.

## Technologies Used
The frontend of the application is developed using **HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript**, rendered through **Django templates**. This approach allows for a clear separation between frontend presentation and backend logic while keeping the system simple and maintainable.

The backend is developed using **Django (Python)**, which supports rapid development and provides built-in tools for user authentication and data management.

---

## Development Process
The project follows the **Scrum framework**, with work organized into sprints. User stories, tasks, sprint planning, meeting minutes, and individual contribution logs are documented and managed using GitHub.

Each sprint introduces new features and builds upon previous work.
