Meeting Purpose To establish team structure, align on development tools and methodology, define Sprint 1 scope, assign tasks, and prepare demo code due Friday, February 6.

Summary of Discussion:
During its first sprint planning meeting, the team showed excellent cooperation and proactive participation. The front-end and back-end roles were made clear while preserving adaptability for cross-functional assistance. In order to reduce merge conflicts, the team decided to use an Agile Scrum methodology that emphasizes early integration, incremental development, and short sprints.

Significant technical decisions were made regarding development tools and workflow. GitHub was used for version control, and Visual Studio Code was selected as the standard IDE with a feature-branch and pull-request workflow. The back-end stack will use Node.js with MongoDB (Prisma planned), while the front-end will focus on developing the basic UI structure during Sprint 1.

The team verified current progress and went over the demo code requirements that were due on Friday. It was decided that rather than focusing on complete feature completion, the demo should highlight correct setup, fundamental functionality, and teamwork.

Initial user stories were collaboratively drafted to guide development. It focueses on user authentication, meal planning, and personalization features.
