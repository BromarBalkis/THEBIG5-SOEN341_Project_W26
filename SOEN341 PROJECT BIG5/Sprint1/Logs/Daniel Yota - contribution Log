Daniel Yota – Contribution Log

Sprint 1 – MealMajor (SOEN 341 Winter 2026)
Role: fronten & Backend Coordinator

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily in the areas of team coordination, GitHub repository setup, backend preparation, and project documentation. I was responsible for coordinating and facilitating all team meetings, ensuring that discussions remained focused on sprint objectives, deliverables, and deadlines. I also coordinated team-wide decisions regarding the selection of development tools and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), ensuring consistency across all team members and alignment with project requirements.
I set up and structured the GitHub repository according to the project requirements and ensured that all Sprint 1 deliverables were clearly organized within the designated folder hierarchy. I created and configured the Sprint 1 directory structure, including folders for demo code, sprint planning documents, meeting minutes, and contribution logs. I also implemented and maintained the overall GitHub structure to support sprint-based development while preserving the integrity of each team member’s work throughout the sprint.
In addition to repository management, I coordinated the organization and maintenance of Sprint 1 documentation to ensure compliance with the course rubric. This included organizing sprint planning documents, meeting minutes, and logs in a clear and traceable manner. I ensured that all documentation was properly formatted and stored in the appropriate locations to support transparency and accountability across the team.
On the backend side, I set up and prepared the initial backend demo code required for the Sprint 1 deliverable. I organized the backend structure and ensured that a functional starting point was available to support user account management features, including registration and login. I coordinated with other team members to ensure alignment between backend functionality and overall project goals, while also completing my assigned sprint tasks as planned.
my contributions overall ensured that the team had a well-structured GitHub repository, coordinated and productive meetings, organized and compliant documentation, and a functional backend foundation to support the Sprint 1 demonstration and future development.
