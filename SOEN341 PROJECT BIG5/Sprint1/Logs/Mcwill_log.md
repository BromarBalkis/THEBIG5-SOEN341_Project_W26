Mcwill Buikpor – Contribution Log

Sprint 1 – MealMajor (SOEN 341 Winter 2026)
Role: Front-End Developer

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily to the front-end development of the MealMajor application. My focus was on building the initial user interface layout and supporting the creation of basic front-end pages required for the project’s early functionality. I worked on structuring the visual layout of the application to ensure consistency, usability, and alignment with the sprint objectives.

I assisted in developing the foundational front-end components, including setting up the initial page structure and applying basic styling to support a clean and user-friendly interface. This involved organizing UI elements in a logical manner and ensuring that the pages could later be easily connected to backend functionality. I collaborated closely with the other front-end team member to maintain consistency across pages and to align design decisions with the overall project vision.

In addition, I supported the styling process by applying CSS and layout adjustments to improve readability and visual flow. My contributions helped establish a solid front-end foundation that can be expanded upon in future sprints as additional features and interactivity are introduced.

Overall, my work during Sprint 1 ensured that the project had a functional and organized initial front-end structure, providing a strong starting point for continued UI development and integration with backend features in upcoming sprints.
