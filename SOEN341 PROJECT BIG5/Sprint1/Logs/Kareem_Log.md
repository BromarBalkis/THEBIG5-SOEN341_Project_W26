Kareem Dadouche – Contribution Log

Sprint 1 – MealMajor (SOEN 341 Winter 2026)
Role: Front-End Developer & GitHub Setup

During Sprint 1, I contributed primarily in two key areas: GitHub project setup and Front-End development. I was responsible for structuring the repository according to the project requirements and ensuring that all Sprint 1 deliverables were organized clearly within the designated folder hierarchy. 
I created and configured the Sprint1 directory structure, including folders for Demo Code, Sprint Plan, Minutes, and Logs. I also implemented the branch-based Git workflow by creating and working on the kareem-sprint1 branch, ensuring that all changes were properly committed, pushed, and merged via Pull Request 
into the main branch.

In addition to repository management, I structured and formatted GitHub Issues according to the required Scrum format using US.## for user stories and Task.## for implementation tasks. I ensured traceability between issues and the Sprint Plan table (Appendix A format) by aligning issue numbers, story points, risk levels, and assigned responsibilities. 
I created and finalized the Sprint Plan documentation and ensured it complied with the rubric requirements.
On the front-end side, I began the implementation of user interface components for Sprint 1 features, including the structure for registration, login, and profile management pages. I prepared the base layout and coordinated with the backend team to ensure alignment between UI forms and authentication logic. My work focused on ensuring that at least one
User Account Management feature could be successfully demonstrated as required for the sprint deliverable.

Overall, my contributions ensured that the team had a properly structured GitHub workflow, organized documentation, traceable issue tracking, and a functional starting point for the front-end implementation of the authentication system.
