Sprint 1 – Meeting Minutes

Project: MealMajor – A Meal Prep and Healthy Living Planner
Course: SOEN 341 – Winter 2026
Meeting Type: Sprint 1 Planning
Date: Thursday, February 6, 2026
Time: 8:00 – 8:45
Location: Online

**Attendees**
Daniel Yota (Front/Back-end), Saib Merabet (Back-end), Omar Balkis (Back-end), Kareem Dadouche (Front-end), Mcwill Buikpor (Front-end)

Meeting Purpose
To establish team structure, align on development tools and methodology, define Sprint 1 scope, assign tasks, and prepare demo code due Friday, February 6.

**Summary of Discussion**
The team held its first sprint planning meeting and demonstrated strong collaboration and proactive engagement. Roles were clarified between front-end and back-end while maintaining flexibility for cross-functional support. The team agreed to adopt an Agile Scrum approach with short sprints, incremental development, and early integration to minimize merge conflicts.

Key technical decisions were made regarding development tools and workflow. Visual Studio Code was selected as the common IDE, with GitHub used for version control following a feature-branch and pull-request workflow. The back-end stack will use Node.js with MongoDB (Prisma planned), while the front-end will focus on establishing core UI structure during Sprint 1.

The team reviewed the demo code requirements due Friday and validated current progress. It was agreed that the demo should emphasize proper setup, basic functionality, and team coordination rather than full feature completion.

Initial user stories were collaboratively drafted to guide development, focusing on user authentication, meal planning, and personalization features.
