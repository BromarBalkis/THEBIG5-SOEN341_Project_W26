## Project Overview
MealMajor is a student-focused web application that helps users plan weekly meals, manage groceries, and discover or create simple recipes. The application is designed to promote organized meal planning and healthier eating habits.

This project is developed as part of **SOEN 341 – Software Process (Winter 2026)** and follows an **Agile development approach** based on the **Scrum framework**, with the project delivered incrementally across multiple sprints.

---

## Core Modules

### 1. User Account Management
- User registration and login  
- User profile management, including dietary preferences and allergy information  

### 2. Recipe Management
- Create, edit, and delete recipes  
- Manage recipe details such as ingredients, preparation time, steps, and cost  
- Search for recipes  
- Filter recipes by time, difficulty, cost, and dietary tags  

### 3. Weekly Meal Planner
- Build weekly meal plans displayed in a grid format  
- Assign recipes by day of the week and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)  
- Edit or remove planned meals  
- Prevent duplicate recipes within the same week  

---

## Technologies Used
The frontend of the application is developed using **HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript**, rendered through **Django templates**. This approach allows for a clear separation between frontend presentation and backend logic while keeping the system simple and maintainable.

The backend is developed using **Node JS (Javascript)**, which supports rapid development and provides built-in tools for user authentication and data management.

---

## Development Process
The project follows the **Scrum framework**, with work organized into sprints. User stories, tasks, sprint planning, meeting minutes, and individual contribution logs are documented and managed using GitHub.

Each sprint introduces new features and builds upon previous work.

Others

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
