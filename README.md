## Project Overview
MealMajor is a student-focused web application designed to help users plan weekly meals, manage groceries, and discover or create simple recipes. The application aims to promote organized meal planning and healthier eating habits through an intuitive web interface.

This project is developed as part of **SOEN 341 – Software Process (Winter 2026)** and follows an **Agile development approach** based on the **Scrum framework**. The project is divided into multiple sprints, with each sprint delivering incremental features.

The goal is not to produce a market-ready product, but to develop a **middle-fidelity prototype** that demonstrates proper software engineering practices and collaborative development.
